# Transmitting-Signal-Project
Given a transmitted signal and the formulas for how the signal was received at varying distances from the transmitter, I was able to write a MATLAB program that compared these two signals at varying distances between the transmitter and receiver.
This project was done for Dr. Khoubroy's signals and systems class at the University of Texas at Dallas.
